# Identity and Access Management

With this framework (IAM) you can give an individual the right access, resource and time for the right reasons.

# Key terminology

1. *Authentication* : a method, act or process of showing something to be real and true.
2. *Authorization* : checks if the person has the right permit to do somthing.
3. *principle of least privilege* : must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.


# Exercise

* The difference between authentication and authorization.
* The three factors of authentication and how MFA improves security.
* What the principle of least privilege is and how it improves security.

## Multifactor Authentication

If there are multiple authentication factors being done its called Multifactor authentication (MFA).

There are three authentication factors :

* Knoledge factor : This is something the person know e.g. password, pernonal identification number (PIN) or a security question. 
* Possession factor : This is something the person have e.g. SIM card, Mobile phone, Smart card, security key or a security token.
* Inherence factor : This is something the person is e.g. fingerprint, retina pattern, face recognition, your personal ID card.

With those three factors of authentication the server can identify it is the right person.

For a hackers its hard to get all those credentials of the target.

## Principle of least privilege.
This is a concept that an user should only have access to what they absulutly need. If the user can have access to all network, data and system it can have some great negative impact on the company.
