# Data types and comments

In python you can work with diffrent types of data like :str, int, bool, etc.

# Key terminology

1. *str* : String format (letters)
2. *int* : Interger format (numbers)
3. *bool* : Boolean format (True or False)
3. *#* : Single line comment
4. *''' '''* : Multiline comments 
5. *type* : Can show you what format the variable holds.
6. *input* : With this you can store data of the user in a variable.

# Exercise

Exercise 1:
* Create a new script.
* Copy the code below into your script.

a = 'int'
b = 7
c = False
d = "18.5"

* Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.
* Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
* Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

Exercise 2:
* Create a new script.
* Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
* Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).

# Results

Printed all types of the different values.

str is string format (letters)
int is interger format (numbers)
bool is boolean format (True or False)

"d" is in string format and it needed to be changed to a float in order to do a calculation.

Input of user will be stored in a variable and the type will be printed out.
