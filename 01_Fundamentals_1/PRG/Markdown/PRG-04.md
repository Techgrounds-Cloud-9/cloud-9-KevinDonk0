# Loops

Pythyon provide three ways of loops : for loop, while loop and nested loop.(for loop in a for loop)

# Key terminology

1. *for* : for iterator_var (index) in sequence : statements
2. *while* : while condition: statements, if not break out of the loop.
3. *range* is a function that returns a sequence of numbers.
4. *[]* : Symbol for list items (this is an empty list)

# Exercise

Exercise 1:
* Create a new script.
* Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
* Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

Exercise 2:
* Create a new script.
* Copy the code below into your script.
 for i in range(10):
    do something here
* Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
* Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
* Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

Exercise 3:
* Create a new script.
* Copy the array below into your script.
* arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
* Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.

For loop that inerate over all numbers start at 0 go to 50 using 5 step each time.

For loop will inerate over list items and print it in terminal.
