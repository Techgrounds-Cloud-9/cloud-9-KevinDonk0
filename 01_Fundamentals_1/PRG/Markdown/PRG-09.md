Number Guessing:
* Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (or any other range).
* The player guesses a number. For every wrong answer the player receives a clue.
* When the player guesses the right number, display a score.

Rock Paper Scissors:
* The player plays against a computer opponent typing either a letter (rps) or an entire word (rock paper scissors) to play their move.
* Create a function that checks whether the move is valid or not.
* Create another function to create a computer move.
* Create another function to check who wins the round.
* Finally, create a function that keeps track of the score.
* The game should be played in a predetermined number of rounds.

Tic-Tac-Toe:
* Generate a 3x3 board on the command line.
* This is a 2-player game, where one player inputs “X” and the other player inputs “O”.
* Bonus: create a single-player version that you can play against the computer.
