# Functions

Is a block of code which only runs when its called. You can pass data to the parameters.
functions can return data as a result.

# Key terminology

1. *import* : by using imports will make you more productive and allowing you to reuse code. If you use "from" you can also select a smaller part of the import.
2. *def* : stand for function, this is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

# Exercise

Exercise 1:
* Create a new script.
* Import the random package.
* Print 5 random integers with a value between 0 and 100.

<br>

Exercise 2:
* Create a new script.
* Write a custom function myfunction() that prints “Hello, world!” to the terminal. Call myfunction.
* Rewrite your function so that it takes a string as an argument. Then, it should print “Hello, \<string>!”.

<br>

Exercise 3:
* Create a new script.
* Copy the code below into your script.
* def avg():   
* x = 128
* y = 255
* z = avg(x,y)
* print ("The average of",x,"and", y, "is", z)

* Write the custom function avg() so that it returns the average of the given parameters.
