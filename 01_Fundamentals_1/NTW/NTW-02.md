# Network Devices

Network devices are called hardware devices that like printers, computers, routers, faxes and other electronical devices.


# Key terminology

1. *router* : connect two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks.
2. *switch* : based on the MAC and hardware addressed this device can transmit incoming data packets to correct ports.
3. *repeater* : repeat the signal so it becomes stronger and can be send further away.
4. *access point* : The access point can either act like a router that transmits data to a other access point or can act like a bridge that connects to a wireless network to a wireless network device.
5. *hub* : Can process incoming data packets and send data packets to all connected devices.
6. *modem* : Performs analog to digital signal of various frequencies and transmits them to the modem at the receivers location.

# Exercise

* Name and describe the functions of common network devices ?

* Most routers have a list of all connected devices, find this list. What other information does the router have about connected devices?

* Where is your DHCP server on your network? What are its configurations?
