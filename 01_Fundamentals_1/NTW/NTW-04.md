## Decimal to binary

16/2 = remainder 0

8/2 = remainder  0

4/2 = remainder  0 

2/2 = remainder  0

1/2 = remainder  1

Answer is 0001 0000 in binary

<br>

16 = 0001 0000 

128 = 1000 0000

228 = 1110 0100

112 = 0111 0000

73 = 0100 1001

## Binary to decimal

1 = 1

0 = 2

1 = 5

0 = 10

1 = 21

0 = 42

1 = 85

0 = 170

Answer is 170

1010 1010 = 170

1111 0000 = 240

1101 1011 = 219

1010 0000 = 160

0011 1010 = 58

## Decimal to hexadecimal

15 / 16 = quotient 0, remainder = 15, hexadicimal = F

Answer is F

37 / 16 = quotient 2, reaminder = (32 - 37 =) 5 hexadecimal = 25

Answer is 25

15 = F

37 = 25

246 = F6

125 = 7D

209 = D1

<br>

## Hexadecimal to decimal

(88)₁₆ = (8 × 16¹) + remainder 8 = 136

88 = 136

e0 = 224

cb = 203

2f = 47

d8 = 216
