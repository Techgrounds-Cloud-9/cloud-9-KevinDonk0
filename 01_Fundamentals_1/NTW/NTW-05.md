# Overcome challenges

I wasn't able to change my phone private IP settings. This is why i tried it with my modem.

# Results

## Public IP


My computer and phone shows the same public IP addresses, because they are connected to the same modem. The modem receives the signal and send it to the right device by using the Private IP address.

## Private IP


My compyuter and telephone shows different private IP addresses because tehy are two different devices. If they were the same IP addresses my devices couldn't communicate on my local network. The modem doesn't knows where to send it to.

I didn't have the option to change my IP on  my phone.

in my modem i  changed the ip to the same as my pc and it gives a error "configure failed, please try again".

The modem automaticly assigns a new IP address to all my devices.
